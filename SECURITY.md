## Verifying Releases

All releases are:

- Built by GitHub Actions from a tagged commit
- Published to PyPI via **trusted publishing (OIDC)**
- **Signed with sigstore** (keyless signing)
- Accompanied by a **CycloneDX SBOM**

```sh
# Verify sigstore signature (replace vX.Y.Z with the release tag)
uv tool run sigstore verify identity \
    --cert-identity 'https://github.com/IvanAnishchuk/zensical-updates/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/vX.Y.Z' \
    --cert-oidc-issuer 'https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com' \
    --bundle zensical-updates-*.whl.sigstore.json \
    zensical-updates-*.whl

# Verify GitHub attestation
gh attestation verify zensical-updates-*.whl --owner IvanAnishchuk
```

## Safe Harbor

We support responsible security research. Good-faith efforts to discover
and report vulnerabilities will not be met with legal action.
